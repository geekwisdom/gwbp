# GeekWisdom.org 5 Year  Business Plan
 (2019 - 2024)

A Libre Open Office Documement to store my GeekWisdom.org Business Plan (aka: The Worlds 'Most Honest' Business Plan)

# Why am I using GIT for a business plan?

1. GIT is an excellent version control system
2. GITHUB lets others contribute their ideas in a decentralized way,and I am looking for lots of input
3. The people who use and know about GIT are exactly the audience where I am looking for help.

#Preamble: Failure to Launch
I know absolutely nothing about creating business plans. About 8 years ago, I bought the book [business plans for dummies] (https://geekwisdom.org/links/amazon.html?vFqch5OrUPvA=&product=Business-Plans-Canadians-Dummies-Tiffany/dp/1118349121/ref=asc_df_1118349121/), and in that time I picked it up 4 or 5 times for maybe 10 to 15 minutes, the idea of a business plan scares me. It "makes" real something that in my mind is only a 'thought-let'. The idea of having my own business, it's a grandiose, and magic idea, a DREAM (a goal with no specific direction). And the dream turns and turns in my mind with lots of ideas scrambled up like the 'good eggs' breakfast at the Coffee Mill..In a similar way, I start little 'projects', maybe buy the GeekWisdom.org site, or start some PHP code, make a few videos, telling myself "This is it, I'm going to launch", and then fall right back into my 'comfy' world, my regular '9-5 job' (or more accurately 8:15 - 4:30). The point is, they are not 'full blown' ideas, so I can easily walk away when the going gets tough, and I know the going will get tough it happens every time, and it probably the reason why I don't pick up the business plan book

#What do I want?

The really short answer..I want to work for myself, I want to create “something” which is NON-PROFIT, generates both passive and active income for me and my family, allows me to make my own decisions, and my own mistakes while at the same time that  “something” helps the world grow a little better.

I have a clear vision, and it is s NOT to become rich (but maybe a little "famous' would be nice). I don't think the pursuit of money brings happiness, so if your reading this and are the kind of person chasing the almighty dollar, like some religions zealot, then this business is probably not for you. Particularly, I would like my business to be non-profit. That is not to say that I don't draw a salary from it (and maybe even provide a salary for others). I feel setting a goal to make profit is contrary to the values of my business. [and contrary to my own personal values]. I recognize this means  I am unlikely to attract venture capitalists, or maybe even banks to "invest" in my idea because what is their return (probably nothing)

GeekWisdom.org is about me creating content (computer programs, videos, blogs, audio), delivering public speeches. What I am **"selling" is myself**, and my idea that the world we live in is not as 'ugly' as we sometimes make it out to be, that if we learn to embrace our 'inner geek', and share our knowledge, maybe this will make he world a better place. If we simply envision the world as we want it to be, and not as it is today. 

Of course, this isn't some brilliant new idea, and I realize may sound a little 'in the clouds' and even 'flaky', but people do this all the time! Stephen Covey, Wayne Dyer, Anthony Robbins, ZigZiglar, Dale Carnegie -  these are all examples of people who sold themselves..and this trend continues today on YouTube, with hundreds (thousands) of people making videos getting subscribers, and making a living creating this content. So it would seem it is at least 'possible'

I WANT to be known, I WANT to be remembered for something, I want a 'legacy'. Probably most people want this. Of course, I already have a legacy, as a confident responsible husband & father, people around me respect my thoughts and ideas (or so I assume), but the medium isn't "BIG" enough for me, I am not really sure why. Like in RALPH breaks the INTERNET, RALPH saw the negative comments left for him on 'YouTube' and was horrified... So why do I want to put myself, open myself up to that? Yep - Not everyone is going to LOVE me, but maybe those that find my ideas worthy and interesting, will at least have their lives helped, or changed. Perhaps even in some fundamental way.

I am not trying to create a religion, or a group of 'followers', actually just the opposite, I want people to WAKE UP and follow their own PATH, to find their authentic selves, though their own self learning paths. This carries with it a couple of problems. A) people might make choices "in the same of GeekWisdom" which are against my original intent, B) people might ust be 'followers' of me so they switch from following one 'GURU' to another, or just add me to their list of existing 'Guru's. I want them to find their inner geek, to become their own 'GURU'.

Okay well t_hat's my preamble, written when I am sure I should have been doing more 'responsible' things' if you are still with me, [onward and upward](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/Onward+and+upward!) !
